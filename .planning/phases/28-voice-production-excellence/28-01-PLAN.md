<objective>
Persist voice registry to Scene DNA so character-voice mappings survive wizard reload.

Purpose: VOC-07 requires voice selections to persist across scenes. Currently VoiceRegistryService
is session-only (instantiated fresh each request). This plan adds serialization methods and
integrates with Scene DNA persistence.

Output: VoiceRegistryService with toArray/fromArray methods, VideoWizard.buildSceneDNA includes
voice registry snapshot, loadSceneMemory restores registry from DNA.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add serialization methods to VoiceRegistryService</name>
  <files>modules/AppVideoWizard/app/Services/VoiceRegistryService.php</files>
  <action>
Add two methods to VoiceRegistryService for serialization:

1. `toArray(): array` - Export registry state for persistence:
```php
public function toArray(): array
{
    return [
        'characterVoices' => $this->characterVoices,
        'narratorVoiceId' => $this->narratorVoiceId,
        'internalVoiceId' => $this->internalVoiceId,
        'lastValidatedAt' => now()->toIso8601String(),
    ];
}
```

2. `fromArray(array $data): void` - Restore registry state:
```php
public function fromArray(array $data): void
{
    $this->characterVoices = $data['characterVoices'] ?? [];
    $this->narratorVoiceId = $data['narratorVoiceId'] ?? null;
    $this->internalVoiceId = $data['internalVoiceId'] ?? null;

    Log::debug('VoiceRegistry restored from persisted data (VOC-07)', [
        'charactersRestored' => count($this->characterVoices),
        'narratorVoice' => $this->narratorVoiceId,
    ]);
}
```

Add logging to track persistence. Do NOT modify existing methods.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `php artisan tinker --execute="$r = new \Modules\AppVideoWizard\Services\VoiceRegistryService(); \$r->initializeFromCharacterBible(['characters' => [['name' => 'Alice', 'voice' => ['id' => 'nova']]]], 'fable'); print_r(\$r->toArray());"`
Should output array with characterVoices containing ALICE => nova.
  </verify>
  <done>VoiceRegistryService can export and import its state via toArray/fromArray.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Integrate voice registry into Scene DNA persistence</name>
  <files>modules/AppVideoWizard/app/Livewire/VideoWizard.php</files>
  <action>
Locate the buildSceneDNA() method (or equivalent method that builds the sceneDNA array).

Add voice registry snapshot to the DNA structure:

1. Find where sceneDNA is built (likely in a method like `buildSceneDNA()` or within scene generation).

2. Add helper method `buildVoiceRegistryForDNA()`:
```php
protected function buildVoiceRegistryForDNA(): array
{
    $characterBible = $this->sceneMemory['characterBible'] ?? [];
    $registry = app(\Modules\AppVideoWizard\Services\VoiceRegistryService::class);
    $registry->initializeFromCharacterBible($characterBible, $this->getNarratorVoice());
    return $registry->toArray();
}
```

3. Include in sceneDNA structure:
```php
$sceneDNA['voiceRegistry'] = $this->buildVoiceRegistryForDNA();
```

4. In the `loadSceneMemory()` method (search for "function loadSceneMemory" around line 200-400), add restoration logic at the END of the method, after existing sceneMemory hydration:
```php
// Voice Registry restoration (VOC-07)
if (!empty($this->sceneMemory['sceneDNA']['voiceRegistry'])) {
    $registry = app(\Modules\AppVideoWizard\Services\VoiceRegistryService::class);
    $registry->fromArray($this->sceneMemory['sceneDNA']['voiceRegistry']);
    Log::debug('VideoWizard: Voice registry restored from Scene DNA (VOC-07)');
}
```

Search for existing sceneDNA patterns in the file to match coding style.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n "voiceRegistry" modules/AppVideoWizard/app/Livewire/VideoWizard.php`
Should show:
- buildVoiceRegistryForDNA method definition
- sceneDNA['voiceRegistry'] assignment in buildSceneDNA
- Voice registry restoration in loadSceneMemory

Run: `grep -n "fromArray.*voiceRegistry" modules/AppVideoWizard/app/Livewire/VideoWizard.php`
Should show the restoration code in loadSceneMemory method.
  </verify>
  <done>Voice registry persists in Scene DNA and restores on wizard load.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. Run: `grep -c "toArray\|fromArray" modules/AppVideoWizard/app/Services/VoiceRegistryService.php` - should return 2 or more
2. Run: `grep -c "voiceRegistry" modules/AppVideoWizard/app/Livewire/VideoWizard.php` - should return 3 or more
3. Run: `php artisan tinker --execute="$r = app(\Modules\AppVideoWizard\Services\VoiceRegistryService::class); \$r->fromArray(['characterVoices' => ['ALICE' => 'nova'], 'narratorVoiceId' => 'fable']); echo \$r->getVoiceForCharacter('Alice');"` - should output "nova"
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] VoiceRegistryService.toArray() exports all voice mappings
- [ ] VoiceRegistryService.fromArray() restores state correctly
- [ ] Scene DNA includes voiceRegistry snapshot
- [ ] Voice selections survive browser refresh
- [ ] No regression in existing voice functionality
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/28-voice-production-excellence/28-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
