# Phase 1.5 Plan 02: Detection Summary UI Summary

**Replaced Character Intelligence manual configuration with read-only Detection Summary panel showing auto-detected speech segments and character voice status**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T23:30:55Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T23:39:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Removed 322 lines of Character Intelligence UI code (HTML and CSS)
- Added Detection Summary panel with segment statistics (total, lip-sync, voiceover, duration)
- Character voice assignment status display with visual indicators
- Speech type breakdown visualization
- Panel renders only when segments exist (graceful empty state)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove Character Intelligence UI section** - `c9b67aa` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add Detection Summary panel** - `add0cbe` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Add supporting CSS if needed** - `bf10d4f` (style)

## Files Created/Modified

- `modules/AppVideoWizard/resources/views/livewire/steps/concept.blade.php` - Replaced Character Intelligence UI with Detection Summary panel

## Decisions Made

1. **Full removal of Character Intelligence UI** - The manual configuration (narration style, character count) is no longer needed since speech segments are auto-detected from the script.

2. **Tailwind utility classes for styling** - Detection Summary panel uses Tailwind classes (bg-gray-800/50, rounded-lg, etc.) for consistency with the existing design and easier maintenance.

3. **Conditional rendering** - Panel only appears when `$detectionSummary['totalSegments']` is non-empty, avoiding empty state UI complexity.

4. **Voice status color coding** - Green (bg-green-900/30) for characters with voice assigned, yellow (bg-yellow-900/30) for characters needing voice configuration in Character Bible.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - the Character Intelligence section was clearly identifiable and the Detection Summary panel integrated smoothly with existing Tailwind/Blade patterns.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Detection Summary panel is ready and will display data when $detectionSummary is populated
- Plan 1.5-01 already provides the parseScriptIntoSegments method that populates detectionSummary
- Ready for Plan 1.5-03 to wire up characterIntelligence property migration
- Ready for Plan 1.5-04 to ensure segment data flows to shots correctly
