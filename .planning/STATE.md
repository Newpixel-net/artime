## Current Focus

**Milestone 11: Hollywood-Quality Prompt Pipeline**

Goal: Transform prompt generation to produce 600-1000 word Hollywood screenplay-level prompts

Target prompt depth:
- Image prompts: 600-1000 words (from 50-80)
- Video prompts: 600-1000 words (from ~100)
- Voice prompts: Full emotional direction (from type only)

Key gaps to close:
- Micro-expressions, detailed body language
- Temporal progression in video prompts
- Emotional direction and pacing markers in voice
- Physical continuity across shots

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Date | Area | Decision | Rationale |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-25 | Milestone | Pivot from M10 to M11 | Prompt quality is more critical than performance |
| 2026-01-25 | Scope | All three together | Image, video, voice prompts enhanced in parallel |
| 2026-01-25 | Approach | Research first | Study Hollywood screenplay/cinematography patterns |

### Research Insights

From codebase exploration (2026-01-25):
- Current image prompts: 50-80 words (capped in buildShotPrompt)
- Current video prompts: ~100 words
- Existing infrastructure: StructuredPromptBuilderService, VideoPromptBuilderService
- Gap: 10-15x expansion needed in prompt detail
- Key methods: buildStoryVisualContent, buildActionComponent, buildSubjectFromSceneDNA
