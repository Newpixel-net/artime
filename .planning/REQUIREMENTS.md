## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Voice cloning | Legal complexity, use existing provider voices |
| Real-time voice streaming | Not needed for video production workflow |
| Voice training | Requires ML infrastructure beyond scope |
| Lip-sync 3D avatars | Focus on 2D video generation |
